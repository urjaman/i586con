   1eGRUB217
    Loads a memdisk-based small GRUB 2. It can load hard-disk based installs
    of i586con (and the CD), and also use native GRUB2 drivers for disk access.
    By using the GRUB commandline it is also possible to chainload DOS/NTFS
    partitions, etc.

    This image (boot/grubflop.bin) can also be written to a floppy, for
    booting systems that can't boot from CD.

   1eMemtest86+17
    An utility to test your RAM (if you're having unexplained issues).

   1ePoweroff17
