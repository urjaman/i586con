  1fWhat is 'i586con'?17

  It's a badly named livecd for Pentium-class machines. i586 CONsole.
  Primary use cases are data rescue and repartitioning duties.
  It can run entirely from RAM, so you can access other CDs or entirely
  repartition the hard drive even it was booted from the HD.

  But the system is certainly capable of doing more than just that.
  You can use it as a thin 1essh17 client, a music player (1emocp17),
  a really poor web browser (try 1elinks -g17)...

  You can install it on the HD (1ehdinstall17), but mind you this is just
  a way to load the same livecd experience from the HD (even a FAT partition).
  Rudimentary state saving (1ehd_save17) is available.
