  Heyhihello, this is 1fi586con17 1e%VERSION%17

  The boot modes, in short:
  
   1fLinux To RAM17 - Use this by default
    17Uses linux drivers (small initramfs) to load the rootfs.img (and save.tgz)
    Requires 64MB of RAM. Boot media is not required after boot is complete.

   1fRun from CD17 - Use this if low RAM
    17Uses linux drivers to access the rootfs.img (and save.tgz).
    Requires 16MB of RAM. Boot media is needed for the full duration of use.

   1fBIOS to RAM17 - The backup option
    17Uses isolinux (BIOS level access) to load rootfs.img directly as initramfs
    Requires 64MB of RAM. Boot media is not required after boot is complete.
    Works even if linux has no drivers for the boot media.
    Might be slower than Linux to RAM.
    Does not support state saving via multisession CD-Rs.
