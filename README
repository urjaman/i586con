This is the recipes for a little CONsole-only linux for i586's (or better)
(thus the i586con name) based on buildroot, for use when you just
need to get to a commandline with some tools pretty quickly.

A little list of notable tools i've picked:
- the usual cli partitioning tools
- ntfs-3g and ntfsprogs
- ddrescue
- rsync
- cdrkit (wodim, genisoimage)
- flashrom

How to build:
./fextract.sh to download and extract buildroot
./init_bdir.sh to initialize a build directory
(optionally make make menuconfig or make linux-menuconfig
 if you need/want to adjust the kernel or package selection etc)
make to build it (hopefully)

In case you just want the result right now, i have one here:

Tech notes:
----------
The boot method is kernel + an actual initrd
(the RAMDISK style, with a squashfs on it), so 
that it can fit the entire linux into 64M of ram,
and the boot media can be removed after the bootloader
phase.

Overlayfs and tmpfs are combined to make
the interesting parts of the filesystem writable
(only in ram so everything is lost on reboot or shutdown).

It will try to bring up up to one internet
connection (LAN only) using DHCP, and then
brings up a ssh daemon (no logins are possible
until somebody sets a password for some account),
and it will do this in a very ghetto way 
(eudev runs a script that runs another script
in a screen that was started into the background
earlier during the boot).
